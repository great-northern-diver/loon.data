#' Data  on 145 non-obese patients collected at the Stanford Clinical Reseach Center to investigate "the relationship between
#' chemical subclinical and overt nonketotic diabetes.  The three primary variables used in the analysis and  presented [here] are glucose intolerance, insulin response
#  to oral glucose, and insulin resistance."
#  
#  From Andrews and Herzberg (1985) book called "Data". See reference.

#
#  The purpose of the data was to investigate
#  
#  "the relationship between chemical subclinical
#   and overt nonketotic diabetes in 145 non-obese
#   adult subjects.
#   The three primary variables used in the analysis and
#   presented [here] are glucose intolerance, insulin response
#   to oral glucose, and insulin resistance.  The first two
#   [of these] variables are the areas under the straightline
#   connecting glucose and insulin levels, respectively,
#   determined from blood samples drawn during a three hour
#   glucose tolerance test following an oral administration
#   of a glucose load. [These are variables GlucoseArea and
#   InsulinArea, respectively.] Insulin resistance is measured
#   by the steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) determined
#   afterchemical suppression of endogenous insulin secretion.
#   In addition, the relative weight and fasting plasma
#   glucose were measured for each individual at the Stanford
#   Clinical Reseach Center and are included [here]"
#
#  Each row of diabetes is a patient, and the row number
#  is the "Patient Number" from Andrews and Herzberg.
