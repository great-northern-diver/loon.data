#' @title A fictional data set on lizards perch choices
#'
#' @description 
#' An entirely artificially constructed data set and context designed for classroom discussion and
#' analysis. 
#' 
#' The fictional context is that 384 different lizards have been observed in nature, from each of 4 different species ("A", "B", "C", or "D").
#' In addition to their species, the sex of each lizard was identified.   
#' At the time of observation, each lizard was perched on the branch of a bush.
#' The perch height from the ground in feet was measured and the diameter in inches of the branch where the lizard was perched was measured.
#' Lizards are collected and numbered (row.names) in the order they appear in the data set.
#' 
#' We could imagine the study having proceeded as follows.
#' 
#' Problem:
#' 
#' Suppose that we are interested in the habitat of lizards on some other remote island archipelago. 
#' Here there are trees of all heights and many different species of lizards. 
#' Interest lies in understanding the perch height preference for all lizards.
#' 
#' Plan:
#' 
#' As with the source study, lizards will be observed during daylight hours for four separate
#' summer time expeditions. The height (in feet) at which the lizard is observed will be
#' recorded as is the diameter (in inches) of the branch where the lizard is perched.
#' The species and sex of each lizard will be recorded.
#' 
#' Data:
#' A total of 384 lizards of several species were captured and measured together with the
#' height and diameter of their perch when first spotted.
#' 
#' 
#' NOTE:  The data are inspired by the reference but are otherwise entirely fictional and constructed primarily for pedagogical purposes.
#'  Instructors might choose to invent their own context.
