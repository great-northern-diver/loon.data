#' @details 
#' Data on the biomass (Mg/ha) of dominant forest species from several sample plots (sites)
#' in Alaska, each sampled over several years.  Original data taken from the Cooperative Alaska
#' Forest Inventory website.

#' From website:
#' 
#' "The Cooperative Alaska Forest Inventory (CAFI) is a comprehensive database of boreal 
#'  forest conditions and dynamics in Alaska. The CAFI consists of field-gathered information
#'  from numerous permanent sample plots distributed across interior and south-central Alaska 
#'  including the Kenai Peninsula. 
#'  The CAFI currently has 570 permanent sample plots on 190 sites representing a wide variety 
#'  of growing conditions. New plots are being added to the inventory annually."
