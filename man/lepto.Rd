\title{Rock Crabs (Leptograpsus variegatus) data}
\format{
A data frame with 200 rows and 5 variables
\describe{
 \item{front}{The length in millimetres of the crab's carapace frontal lobe region just before the "frontal tubercles".}
 \item{rear}{The length in millimetres of the crab's carapace rear.}
 \item{length}{This is a measurement (in mm) of the length  of the crab's carapace from front to rear along its centre line.}
 \item{width}{This is a measurement (in mm) of the width of the carapace of the crab at its widest point.}
 \item{depth}{This is a measurement (in mm) of the depth of the crab body.}
}

There are known to be four distinguishable subsets in this data set.

\description{
Body measurements on a sample of 200 (purple) rock crabs (Leptograpsus variegatus) found in the southern subtropical Pacific Ocean.
These are small sea crabs that grow at most to about 50 millimetres of shell width.

The objective is to determine whether the sample actually represents two different species of rock crab base only on their
physical measurements. See reference for details.

\details{
These are physical measurements on the purple rock crab (Leptograpsus variegatus), a large eyed
 crab found in the southern subtropical Pacific ocean. These are small sea crabs that grow at most to
 about 50 millimetres of shell width. 
 
 Data are a subset of the \code{crabs} data set from the \code{MASS} package.  
 Only the five size measurements or the crabs are given here and their order has been randomized.
 
 A good data set for cluster analysis
