    <p>See reference for details.</p>
<p>On the meaning of the <code>error</code> variable, from the reference:
"This error is rarely a standard deviation.  Nor is it based solely on measurements taken
in the study.  Instead, it is a number out together bt the researchers from a number
of possible sources and is very subjective.  It is not uncommon for subsequent researchers
to examine in detail the results of a given study and to arrive at a different value
of the error.   Finally, physicists are accustomed to reporting the probable error which
can be interpreted as approximately 0.6745 times the standard deviation of the estimate."</p>

<p>On the meaning of variables related to <code>method</code>, also from the reference:</p>
<p><code>Optical</code>: These methods are based on having a light beam leave a source, strike a <code>rotating
mirror</code> or pass through the spaces of a <code>toothed wheel</code>, travel some considerable distance to
be reflected back (again striking the rotating mirror or passing through the spaces of a
toothed wheel) to near the original soource.  The speed of rotation must be just right and
is used in the determination of the speed of light.  Precision of estimation could ve increased
by increasing the distance the light had to travel (from source to stationary mirror and back) or
by increasing the speed of rotation.</p>
<p><code>Electrical</code>: This method is introduced after the electromagnetic theory of light was developed.
Light could now be thought of as electromagnetic radiation.  As such measures of the speed of any
<code>electromagnetic radiation in vacuo</code> would also be legitimate measures of the speed of light (in vacuo).
Moreover the <code>ratio of electrostatic to electromagnetic units</code> of measurement of electrical quantities could 
be taken to be measurements of the speed of light.</p>
<p><code>Electro-optical</code>:  These are based largely on the same principle as the toothed wheel in optical
methods which effectively use a mechanical shutter to switch light on and off.
With the <code>electro-optical</code> methods, non-mechanical shutters are used to much more rapidly (and
in a more finely controlled way) alternate the light and so increase the precision.  
The <code>Kerr cell</code> consists of two electrodes immersed in a liquid like nitrobenzene.  When high
voltage is applied to the electrodes, the polarity of light passing through the cell changes
from planar to elliptical.  Switching between high and low voltage effects the shutter.
The <code>quartz modulator</code> passes sound waves through a crystal to change its refractive index.
An acoustic frequency can be found to produce a diffraction grating for light passing through the
crystal; double that frequency and the diffraction grating dissappears.  Switching between the two
frequencies produces the shutter effect.</p>
<p><code>Radio wave</code>: Understanding light to be electromagetic radiation also means that radio waves can 
be used in place of visible light to make measurements of its speed.  
<code>Radar</code> sends a short pulse of high frequency radio waves from a source to a distant object and
measures the time taken to receive the reflected wave from the distant object.  Knowing the
actual distance allows a determination of the speed of the radio wave (or light).
The <code>cavity resonator</code> sends high frequency radio waves down a hollow cylinder sealed at both ends.
The cylinder resonates if its length is a whole number multiple of the half-wavelength of the
radio wave. The speed of light (in the medium within the cylinder or cavity) can be determined
from the dimensions of the cylinder (cavity).</p>
<p><code>Geodetic</code>:  These are improvements on the <code>Kerr cell</code> technology to make it capable of measuring
geodetic distances.  The resulting (commercial) instrument was called a <code>Geodimeter</code>.  With known
distances these instruments could be turned around to be used to provide measures of the speed of
light. The <code>Tellurometer</code> was another instrument invented to determine geodetic distances.  
The principal difference between it and the Geodimeter is that it used microwave radiation to
carry the signal.</p>

<p><code>Spectroscopy</code>: <code>Bombarding molecules with electromagnetic radiation</code> causes them to 
absorb enough energy to change various states.  
Bombarding molecules with microwave radiation changes their
rotational state,  with infra-red radiation their vibrational state.  Quantum theory
allows the measurement of these to changed states to be turned into a determination of the 
speed of light.  Different studies bombarded different molecules.</p>
<p><code>Ultrasonic modulation</code>:  This method can be regarded as an improvement on the <code>quartz modulator</code>.
Instead of acoustic waves on a crystal, a diffraction grating is produced with ultrasonic waves
in a liquid. Turning the diffraction grating on and off produces the shutter.</p>
<p><code>Interferometry</code>:  A single source light bean is split in two.  Each travels some distance, is 
reflected, and returns to the source.  The two are made to travel different distances and
the amount by which they are out of phase with one another upon return, together with the
difference in distances travelled, can be turned into a measure of the speed of light. 
Instead of visible light, <code>radio waves</code> or <code>micro waves</code> were used.</p>
<p><code>Stabilized lasers</code>:  In <code>interferometry</code> there can be some uncertainty in the measure of the
wavelengths used.  With stabilized lasers using a technique called <code>sub-Doppler saturated
absorption spectroscopy</code> it became possible to fix the frequency (and hence the wavelength)
of some lasers within a very narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Such lasers are
called stabilized lasers and have nice short <code>wavelengths</code> (micrometres) that allow more precise
measurements of the speed of light.</p>
